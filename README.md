# zpeg

zpeg is an abstract syntax tree (AST) parser generator based on parsing expression grammar (PEG). It translates parsing expression grammar files into logically equivalent recursive descent parsing algorithms written in Zig.

During the translation process, zpeg analyzes the grammar for logical errors. If the parsing logic would lead the generated parser into infinite recursion or an infinite loop, zpeg reports an error and indicates the location in the grammar that causes the problem.

The PEG syntax accepted by zpeg is documented in [Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) File Syntax Overview](./doc/PEG.md).

This project is self-hosting; its own AST parser is generated by zpeg itself.

## Features

- Unicode support
- Detection and error reporting of left recursion
- Good parser error context recording.

## Usage

Run `zpeg <PEG_FILE_PATH>` to generate an AST parser. The generated parser file can then be used directly as a module in your Zig project.
